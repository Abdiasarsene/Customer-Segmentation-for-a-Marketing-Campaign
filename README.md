# Customer Segmentation for a Marketing Campaign

## 📌 Description

This project aims to segment a company's customers into distinct groups using unsupervised learning algorithms. The goal is to optimize marketing campaigns by offering tailored promotions to each customer segment.

## 📊 Objectives

- **Analyze** customer data to identify trends.
- **Segment** customers into homogeneous groups using clustering techniques.
- **Visualize** the results to interpret the segments.
- **Propose** marketing recommendations based on the insights.
